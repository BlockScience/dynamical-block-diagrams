# Lotkaâ€“Volterra equations for predator-prey dynamics.
#
# This simulation runs for a million steps and is intended to
# demonstrate the performance of compiled diagrams. In this particular
# case, the diagram is compiled to:
#
# function execute_diagram(fish, shark, x_fish, x_shark)
#   steps=1000000
#   while (steps -= 1) >= 0
#     xp_shark = shark(x_fish, x_shark)
#     xp_fish = fish(x_fish, x_shark)
#     x_shark = xp_shark
#     x_fish = xp_fish
#   end
# end
