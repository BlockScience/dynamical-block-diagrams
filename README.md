This research and code explores how block diagrams of dynamical
systems can be executed by a computer program.

- [dynamical-block-diagrams.pdf](/dynamical-block-diagrams.pdf)
  formalizes the problem and provides algorithms for executing and
  validating diagrams.
- [cadCAD.jl](/cadCAD.jl) contains a software implementation of the
  execution algorithms. [spinner.jl](spinner.jl) and
  [consensus-networks.jl](consensus-networks.jl) contain example
  models.

The rest of this document is an overview of the problem and examples.

What are these fish doing?

At the level of detail we're interested in, each fish considers where
it is, where the shark is, and decides where to move next. The shark
does the same thing looking for the fish. Here's an illustration:

  <img src="https://percisely.xyz/fish-diagrams/xymatrix_0.svg" />

What do we need to know to start simulating this? Knowing only the
initial position of the fish is insufficient, as to calculate the next
position of the fish we need to know the position of the shark. The
same can be said about knowing only the initial position of the
shark. So, to simulate this system we need to know the initial
position of the fish and shark.

Now its night time. These fish are avoiding the dots, but they can't
see very well.

Each fish considers where it is, what dots are in its vision, and
decides where to move next. The dots consider where they are and don't
move. Determining what dots are in a fish's vision requires knowing
where the fish is and where the dots are. Here's an illustration:

  <img src="https://percisely.xyz/fish-diagrams/xymatrix_1.svg" />

But what if we also provide the initial vision? If it isn't consistent
with the initial position of the fish, the system will behave
strangely. The drawing below shows a fish who's vision isn't
initialized at the correct position.

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1f8940a-6437-4b25-8d05-b7823a7ee7ca" width="400px" />

So we'd like to know, given a drawing like the ones above:

1. When are the initial values sufficient to execute it?
2. What initial values can lead to inconsistencies?
3. How can a drawing like the ones above be executed efficiently by a computer program?

To answer these questions I needed to use math, which can be found in
[dynamical-block-diagrams.pdf](/dynamical-block-diagrams.pdf). I then
implemented the math in [cadCAD.jl](/cadCAD.jl), to run it:

1. Install [The Julia Programming Language]([url](https://julialang.org/)).
2. Install [UnicodePlots]([url](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/UnicodePlots.jl/tree/main)) by running `echo 'using Pkg; Pkg.add("UnicodePlots")' | julia`.

There are two examples avaliable. The first example simulates a point
being spun around the origin (specification
[here](https://hackmd.io/@ekez/HJTHYT8NA)), but there is a percularity
in the system! which causes the point's distance from the origin to
decrease over time. Can you find it? To run the simulation and plot
the distance from the origin over time, run

The second example simulates a consensus network with twenty agents
based on _Consensus and Cooperation in Networked Multi-Agent Systems_
by Reza Olfati-Saber, J. Alex Fax, and Richard M. Murray. Each agent
starts with a value, and the agents communicate with their neighbors
to try and all agree on a single value. For more details see Carolina
Riascos's [writeup](/Network-Games.pdf).

Future work will document and come up with a nice API for running your
own simulations. For now the code is a research prototype and you can
see the API in the example files.
